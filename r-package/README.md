R Package Template
==================

R has built-in functionality to create a skeleton package for you. From within
R, run the command `package.skeleton()` to create a template.

```r
# Creates base package named "anRpackage"
package.skeleton()

# Creates package with specified name
package.skeleton("rpkg")
```

Another solution is to use RStudio. File > New Project... > New Directory > R
Package
